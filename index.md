## Richa Khagwal - Data Science Enthusiast

### Introduction

Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast, with hands-on experience collecting, analyzing and interpreting large datasets, leveraging machine learning models to uncover insights and drive business growth, with a demonstrated history of working across multiple industries- Retail, Logistics and Supply Chain, IT Technical, and possess an extensive analytical skills, with past expertise building ML models in different domains such as- Natural Language Processing, Time-series Forecasting, Video/ Image Classification, Object detection, Face Recognition, Text Semantics Analysis, Recommendation System, along with 4+ years of prior software development experience in Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL. I also did internship as a "Data Scientist Intern" at "The Wine Group".

I just graduated from California State University, East Bay (May 2020), where, I was engaged in learning and applying Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms in the real-world environment, via variant academic projects each semester, to better utilize the potential that data holds in real. 

I am currently on F1 Visa and authorized to work in OPT without sponsorship till August 2023.
