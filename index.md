## Richa Khagwal - Data Science Enthusiast

### Introduction

Actively seeking Data Science and Machine Learning roles, with hands-on experience collecting, cleaning, analyzing and interpreting large datasets, leveraging machine learning models to uncover insights and drive business growth, with a demonstrated history of working across multiple industries- Retail, Logistics and Supply Chain, IT Technical, Education and possess an extensive analytical skills, with past expertise building ML models in different domains such as- Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Time-series Forecasting, Recommender System etc.

5+ years of experience as a **Data Scientist** in technologies such as- Python, R, SQL, Java.

I graduated with **MS in Computer Science** from **California State University, East Bay** (May 2020), Hayward, CA, where, I was engaged in learning and applying Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms in the real-world environment, via variant academic projects each semester, to better utilize the potential that data holds in real. I also hold **BS degree in Computer Science** from **Rajasthan Technical University** (June 2014), India.

I am currently on F1 Visa and authorized to work in OPT without sponsorship till August 2023.
